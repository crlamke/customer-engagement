# Customer Engagement Process
A customer engagement process I'm creating based on my experience working with various companies for a wide range of customers

Here's what I have so far. 

## Rules of Thumb
1. minimize documentation and process
2. look at current process

## Cycle Definition
1. Form hypothesis of what customer needs or would benefit from
2. Meet with customer to validate/adjust our understanding of their needs
3. Select starting point apps/papers/data for dev/prototype/demo cycles
4. Conduct dev and create prototype
5. Go onsite and install/test prototype with customer data - Allow extra prep onsite for expected difficult prep
6. Demo prototype for customer and get feedback
7. Adjust approach and requirements based on feedback and repeat cycle
8. After customer engagement 
  - action report
  - Copy code and other artifacts of onsite development
  - Update requirements and report to management
9. Plan next cycle

## Notes
Cover PACE planning - at least need fully fleshed out primary and alternate plans

This process is designed to move our effort quickly forward, with minimal time spent looking back. Maintain only those artifacts required to:
-	Account for spending to our management/accounting staff
-	Ensure we document mistakes and lessons learned
-	Capture activities at a high level so we can provide continuity of and don’t repeat approaches we’ve tried
-	Capture customers’ impressions of current status of technology and their enthusiasm for continuing the collaboration with us

Get in and out as quickly and lightly as practical. Take up a minimum of room in the customers’ spaces

Be quick to call off an engagement with the customer if you judge it won’t be worth their time. Respect for the customers’ mission and time is paramount
